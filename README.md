# playwright-and-mcp-expandtesting_api_and_web

API and WEB testing in [expandtesting](https://practice.expandtesting.com/notes/app/) note app. This project contains basic examples on how to use playwright-mcp to test API, WEB and how to combine API and WEB tests. Good practices such as AI prompting, Generative AI, AI debugging, hooks, custom commands and tags, among others, are used. All the necessary support documentation to develop this project is placed here. When it comes to the API part, it deals with the x-www-form-urlencoded content type.

# Tests:

- When creating automated web test, drag both general_web_test_runner.prompt.md and trainning_web_est.prompt.md to the typing area in Cursor. Wait for the test cases to be designed and codified into spec.ts files. Type "Execute trainning_test_web.prompt.md" and hit :arrow_up:. After the execution is finished, input different parameters so the other test cases can be generated. Use equivalents files for automated api tests. 
- Execute ```npx playwright test --ui``` to run your tests with UI Mode. 
- Execute ```npx playwright test``` to execute playwright in headless mode.
- Hit :point_right:**Testing** button on left side bar in VSC and choose the tests you want to execute.
- Execute ```npx playwright test --grep "@BASIC"``` to run the tests tagged with BASIC tag in Powershell.
- Execute ```npx playwright test --grep-invert "@NEGATIVE"``` to run the tests not tagged with NEGATIVE tag in Powershell.
- Execute ```npx playwright test --grep-invert "(?=.*@API)(?=.*@FULL)"``` to run the tests tagged with both API and FULL tags in Powershell.

# Tips:

- API and WEB tests to send password reset link to user's email and API tests to verify a password reset token and reset a user's password must be tested manually as they rely on e-mail verification.
- Grep plugin helps filtering the test to be executed. Study the documentation. 
- For the first time using Cursor generative AI, is it recommended to:
  - Develop a basic functional playwright test case, 
  - Ask the chat GPT to create a trainning_test.prompt.md file for the basic functional playwright test case, 
  - Drag and drop both trainning (e.g. trainning_test_web_.prompt.md) and general runner (e.g. general_web_test_runner.prompt.md) files to the typing area and type "Execute trainning_test_web.prompt.md" and hit :arrow_up:. This way, Cursor will be trainned properly applying the general test parameters into the scope of the current application under test.
